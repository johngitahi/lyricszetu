      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold text-yellow-700">tldr; Lyricszetu is a lyrics site for well-presented, formatted, and no-noise lyrics.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Lyricszetu is a passion project I started this year. Iâ€™ve been trying to learn Kikuyu for the longest time, and Iâ€™ve found music to be a powerful way to reconnect with the language and culture I wasnâ€™t fully immersed in while growing up. To better understand the music, I love singing along â€” something I later learned is called karaoke.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The problem with most lyrics websites is theyâ€™re oversaturated with ads, poorly formatted (often missing phonetic marks), unstable, incomplete, or simply inaccurate. Lyricszetu tries to solve these problems.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Itâ€™s a clean, ad-free (forever, for all users), community-first lyrics platform dedicated to archiving and translating music from under-served East African languages and beyond.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Here, artists and fans alike can contribute lyrics and English translations, making music more accessible and meaningful to a wider audience. I believe lyrics are more than just words â€” they are cultural records, poetic expressions, and a way for people to connect across language and heritage.
