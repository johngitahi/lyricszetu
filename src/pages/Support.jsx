        <strong>Lyricszetu</strong> is a passion project built with love â€” not profit. Itâ€™s a clean, ad-free, community-powered lyrics site for East African music and languages that often donâ€™t get enough attention or care online.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
	 This site runs on minimal costs thanks to simple, low-cost tools â€” enough that I can keep it ad-free. If things ever change, Iâ€™ll only ask for help to keep it online.
